              A <b>histogram</b> is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data:

            <img alt="histogram" src="/assets/histogram.gif" style="height: 200px" /><br /><br />
            <p>
              You will be shown different versions of histograms with <b>different number of bins</b> and you will have
              to <b>judge the underlying data distribution</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the beginning we ask a few introductory questions.

            <p>
              We will record the answers to the tasks and also record the time it took to complete the tasks.
              All data recording is done anonymous. The recorded data and the collected data from the anonymous
              questionnaires will be used for our research analysis. Use of this data will be strictly limited to
              this scientific project.

            <p class="lead">Privacy and anonymity</p>
            <p>
              The participant data is fully anonymous. We will not ask for the name of the participants.
              Participants will only be represented by anonymous, automatically generated tokens. All data will be held
              in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and will not be used for any purpose
              for which it is not expressly permitted.

            <p class="lead">Your participation</p>
            <p>
              Please note that you are free to participate in this study or not as you wish. You can withdraw your
              participation at any time while the study is running. You can ask questions about the study at any time.
              You can ask for any material to be deleted or not to be used in any way.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">How to withdraw from the study</p>
            <p>
              One easy way to withdraw from the study is to just stop finishing the tasks and close your browser window.
              Incomplete material will not be stored and therefore not used in the evaluation of the study. If you would
              like to withdraw after your materials have been submitted, you will have to remember the PARTICIPANT TOKEN
              that is shown at the end of the study, and then please contact Johanna Schmidt
              (<a href="mailto:johanna.schmidt@vrvis.at">johanna.schmidt@vrvis.at</a>).

              We are researchers at the University of Vienna and the VRVis Zentrum f√ºr Virtual Reality und

              interpret data visualizations. We are conducting this study to evaluate different bin sizes for histogram
              visualizations.
